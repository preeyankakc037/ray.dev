# Building my Portfolio Website from Scratch 
# My Portfolio Website  

This is my **personal portfolio website** — a place where I try to look professional while secretly just keeping my **GitHub streak alive 🔥**.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- Looks cool (hopefully).  
- Talks about me (because who else would it talk about?).  
- Responsive design (so it won’t break… unless it does).  
- Hosted on the internet.  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – the holy trinity.  
- Maybe a sprinkle of magic (or just bugs disguised as features).  

---

## Purpose  
- Half portfolio  
- Half experiment  
- Half streak-maintainer  
- Half fun project  
- Half… wait that’s too many halves 

---

## 📸 Sneak Peek  
👉coming soon....................

## 🤝 Contributions  
Not open for contributions (it’s my face on the site 👀).  
But ideas are always welcome!  

---

## Note  
I’m making this mostly to **maintain my streak**.  
But hey, maybe it’ll also help me land a job someday 😉
